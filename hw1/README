Far:

syntax: Far KEY ARCHIVE [name]*

Far uses a single archive file to maintain a collection of regular
files called members. The KEY argument specifies the action to be taken
the ARCHIVE argument specifies the name of the archive file; and the
NAME arguments (if any) are names specifying which files or directories
of files to save or restore or delete

KEYS:
1) r -- for each NAME specified, if there is a member of the archive with
	that name, replace it in the archive by the current version of
	the end of the archive. If NAME specifies a directory rather than
	a file, recursively replace all filenames in that directory
2) x -- extract each NAME specified (create or overwrite file). if no arguments
	extract every file.
3) d -- for each NAME specified, delete from the archive the member with
	that name.
4) t -- PRINT to stdout the size and name of each member of the archive

EXAMPLE: Far r ./
