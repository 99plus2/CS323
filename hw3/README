LZW:

syntax: encode [-m MAXBITS] [-r BLOCK.RATIO]

MAXBITS is a number representing the max table size for the remembered
strings in the table. This number is initially 12, and can't get larger
than 20 or smaller than 9 (the table starts out with the 2^8 ASCII chars.

BLOCK represents the number of characters analyzed before the compression
RATIO is checked against the actual ratio. If numRead * .RATIO < numCompressed
then the table is reset.

syntax: decode

decodes an encoded file. encode outputs MAXBITS in unary at beginning of file
so user doesn't have to remember the value of MAXBITS he used to encode.

the program uses bit fields to keep memory at all times below 2^(2+MAXBITS),
even when rehashing the table, which is dynamically resized when necessary.

this program uses the LZW compression algorithm.

helpful example command:

encode -m 20 < FILE | decode | cmp - FILE

tells you whether the encode/decode worked or not with a table size 2^20
